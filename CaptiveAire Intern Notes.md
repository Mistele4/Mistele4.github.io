## Ductwork
No welding required for instalation--Factory-welded and tested for leaks
Uses round ductwork instead of square ductork
+ Round Ductwork- easier to clean, doesnt build grease, cheaper, less insulation, better acoustics

*Single* vs *Double* wall ductwork:

## Blake Wrenn
Worked with CaptiveAire as an industrial engineer
in charge of layout(sheet metal fabrication) department

He had to learn autoCAD - software

Interns- only a handful, didnt have any till about 4 or 5 years ago
+ worked directy with blake
+ did programming

apprentices would work on the line and be moved to different departments

What would I be doing?

He hopes that I would rotate through as much as possible

Try to spend time in all the different departments

Superviser of Electrical Department- comes off hard but warms off - been there almost 30 years

2 different buildings:

### 1 kitchen -hoods, exhaust, fans - assembly lines 

NPU - modular packaged unit; rooftop with heater + cooling; pushes air back into building whilevent is running

Utility sets - exhaust fan, muhc larger, more volume - more of a single station

PCU - polution control unit - exhaust fan in environments with requirements for exhaust.

### 2 Ductwork, HVAC units
DOAZ - electrical side interesting
- slower because of supply chain issues
Ductwork almost fully automated now
- 7 or 8 peices of equipment that do work for you
- usually always busy

Metal bender, lasaer cutter, etc...

**expect to get dirty**

**safety** - very important, priority grown over last several years
probably need steel toed boots, will provide other safety materials
+ eg kevlar sleeves, apron, safety glasses, ear plugs

quality is also important
*take a look at core fire system*
- Is the more complicated hood - water wash hood(self explanitory) - electrical side of things

R&D would be more beneficial for mechanical
- up in pensylvania

They prior struggled with putting interns with someone on the floor to shadow
- not necessarily engineering person
Most lines now have dedicated engineers fo reach lines
I may be hooked up with one of hte engineering techs now that there are more
